## mineCORE has released

Hello, friends!

mineCORE is now not just a core, but the whole basis for MineOS. MineOS Server and many other things will also be built on it. The core will be amazing and amazing.

Just follow the development. And yes, version 2.0 has already been released, but this is just the beginning of what we are going to do.

Installing from under openOS:

pastebin run 3qMJ5ERb

Good day!

## mineCORE 3.0 Dev

### Hello, friends!

##### mineCORE version: 3.0.010 (dev)

mineCORE 3.0 is a continuation of the second version of the kernel, which includes a lot of chips and buns. For example, an excellent user manager system, and much more. In principle, there are more possibilities than the older brother, but this is a version for testers and developers, and it may work unstable. Consider this.

It is based on OpenKernel.
